# Calibration Log — ERCOT

Continuation of `docs/calibration-log.md` (frozen archive, entries through
2026-07-19) for ERCOT calibration work. Same entry format — `## YYYY-MM-DD — title`,
newest at the BOTTOM. Only this lane's sessions append here, so parallel
per-ISO calibration sessions never conflict (the per-ISO lane convention,
2026-07-19; see `frontend/data/backcast/keepers/README.md`).

## 2026-07-19 — ERCOT-89 (charter + measure-first, owner-authorized): the shoulder-hour online-capability lane CHARTERED and its step-1 measurement EXECUTED — H1 CONFIRMED (model carries 3.6–4.2 GW base-offer merchant headroom in the residual band hours where reality ran a 0.4–0.5 GW online margin, 8–10×), H2 CONFIRMED (CT commits FOR the band hours: ON share 0.71–0.76 vs 0.49–0.52 at bin-matched controls, every bin, both years; CC discriminates by loading depth), attribution = merchant under-dispatch backfilled by ST_GAS; step-2 build OWNER-GATED, keeper UNCHANGED (ercot86)

**Task.** The owner authorized the quantity-side successor charter to the closed
mid-band offer lanes (ERCOT-88 disposition), scope "measurement/charter only".
Charter: `docs/handoffs/ercot-shoulder-online-envelope-2026-07.md` — quantity-side
diagnosis (the DAM availability overlay is class-DAY, only-OUT-is-out, day-flat:
no hour-level commitment state), rule-19/26 reconciliation against the REJECTED
ercot41/43 envelope family (no-cap line: re-price the offline increment, never
compress the co-opt's shared headroom), pre-committed H1/H2 adjudication, and the
rule-13 bright line (conditional ON-share structure admissible; per-hour ON
pinning forbidden).

**Measurement (probe `scripts/probes/ercot89_shoulder_online_measure.py`, artifact
`data/raw/_validation-source/ercot89_shoulder_online_measurement.json`).** NP3-965
sample-day corpus (no new intake), merchant CC/CT statuses + capability per
covered hour, model side from two single-year throwaway replays of the ercot86
keeper (rule 16 — deleted after measurement; slim class/system hourlies harvested
into `results/calibration/ercot86_rtwall_fullspan/hourly/` so future diagnostics
stop re-solving the keeper). Coverage 35/68 (2024), 37/65 (2025) band hours.

**Findings (charter §8).** (1) H1: reality ran the residual band hours on ~325+100
MW (2024) / ~446+77 MW (2025) of merchant ON spare; the model carries 2.3+1.9 /
2.1+1.4 GW of base-offer headroom in the same hours — the quantity is the error,
not the price: at the ERCOT-86 wall's measured per-MW-rank ladders, 10× the spare
MW puts the model's marginal rank deep in the cheap rungs. (2) H2: the thin-margin
state survives net-load conditioning (CT ON share separated in every bin, both
years; CC spare collapses 867→325 / 1,079→446 MW control→resid) — a conditional
forward driver exists. (3) Attribution: total gas matches actuals in both hour
sets; the model substitutes ST_GAS (4.1→6.1 GW control→resid, vs inferred ~1–2 GW
real non-CHP steam) for the merchant CT surge (measured BP 4.3→6.8 GW via starts)
and CC ON-ceiling loading it under-dispatches by ~4.5–5.5 GW. ST_GAS is
rule-19-owned by its own drag lane — reconcile, never stack, in any step-2 D-2
enumeration. Secondary: model carries ~4.6 GW less VRE than reality in the 2024
resid hours (evening solar shape) and still clears $30–80 — a fortiori.

**Disposition.** Measurement supports a build; step 2 (one design round among
charter §6 shapes (a)/(b)/(c) against the §8.5 attribution, default-off gate,
single-year 2024 probe with C3a level guard + zero-spurious + no-scarcity-tail-
degradation guard, then 2025, then full-span LOYO) is OWNER-GATED, not started.
Keeper stays ercot86; nothing registered (the replays reproduce the keeper).
Ops: charter + probe + artifact + sidecars + this entry committed and pushed on
`claude/ercot-88-midband-offer-closed-b997ar`. Next number: ercot-90.
