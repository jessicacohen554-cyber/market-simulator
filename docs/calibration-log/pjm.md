# Calibration Log — PJM

Continuation of `docs/calibration-log.md` (frozen archive, entries through
2026-07-19) for PJM calibration work. Same entry format — `## YYYY-MM-DD — title`,
newest at the BOTTOM. Only this lane's sessions append here, so parallel
per-ISO calibration sessions never conflict (the per-ISO lane convention,
2026-07-19; see `frontend/data/backcast/keepers/README.md`).

## 2026-07-19 — PJM DAM outage/availability data intake (no solve)

Owner-authorized data-intake session (branch `claude/pjm-dam-data-intake-19dqnf`):
fetched PJM Data Miner 2 `gen_outages_by_type` ("Generation Outage for Seven
Days by Type"), 2018-01-01 → 2026-07-19 (65,511 rows), the PJM analogue of
ERCOT's 60-Day DAM disclosure thermal availability and the aggregate-coverage
replacement for the CAMPD unit-outage fallback. Processed by the derive step to
per-year CSVs `data/raw/pjm-outages/by-year/gen_outages_by_type_<YEAR>.csv` + an
efficient `data/raw/pjm-dam-availability.parquet`. **Neither data file is
committed** — the API-only push path can't carry the binary parquet or the
~4.3 MB of CSV rows, and `git push` is disallowed; both regenerate from the
committed fetch+derive scripts in one command, and the loader degrades to the
statistical fallback until they exist. Schema `pjm-outages`. Committed the loader
`market_sim.data.pjm_outages.pjm_dam_availability_series` (a **default-off,
backcast-only** seam); the `ScenarioConfig.pjm_dam_availability` flag + the
`data.fleet` water-fill application (shared with the ERCOT overlay) are the
ready-to-apply patch in `docs/handoffs/pjm-dam-availability-wiring-2026-07.md`,
deferred because they touch two 8k–10k-line core files the API-only push path
can't re-emit safely (rule 27). PJM publishes no per-fuel-class outage split, so
the transform is a fleet-wide uniform derate (forced + maintenance) against the
model's PJM fossil-thermal nameplate; sub-regional totals retained for a future
zone/class refinement. **No LP solved/scored, no keeper, no marker** (the
2018–2022 + H1-2026 out-of-training years enter as data only; validation is no-LP
loader-resolvability / row-count / invariant checks per rule 22).

Committed this session: the raw fetch + derive scripts, the loader module
`data/pjm_outages.py`, the `pjm-outages` schema, the tests, and the wiring
handoff (the data files themselves are the pending item above). Two small
text-only follow-ups were deferred because the API-only push path can't safely
re-emit the 600–1,600-line files they touch: (a) mirror this entry into the
canonical intake ledger `docs/out-of-sample-results-2026-07.md` §1 (as §1.5);
(b) register `pjm-outages` in `scripts/render_data_dictionary.py`'s
`DATATYPE_ORDER` + `NARRATIVE` and re-render `data-dictionary.md` (the schema
currently sits unregistered alongside the pre-existing `dam-public-bids` /
`lmp-components`, which are in the same state). Flagged for the PJM calibration
owner: applying the wiring
(`docs/handoffs/pjm-dam-availability-wiring-2026-07.md`), turning the overlay on,
and choosing its final allocation/denominator is a keeper session subject to the
holdout tiers.
