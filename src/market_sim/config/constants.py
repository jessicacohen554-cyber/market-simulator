# 2x1 CCs the model over-ran in the 80-90% CF range — not a published or
# physically-measured turbine limit, i.e. an answer-key scalar with no
# independent source. Confirmed dead at HEAD before deletion: the current
# ERCOT keeper (2026-07-06-ercot34-stage4-overlay-off) explicitly carries
# `cc_peaking_per_plant=False` (superseded by the measured EIA-860
# duct-burner mechanism, `cc_duct_peaking`/`fleet.cc_duct_peaking_pct`), and
# every non-ERCOT keeper's `cc_peaking_per_plant=True` drives only the
# CAMPD-measured `fleet.thermal_tranche_peaking` path — this dict's four
# ERCOT-specific plant codes never matched any other ISO's fleet. No keeper
# changes behavior from this deletion. Follow-up correction (same sweep): the
# ERCOT DEFAULT builder (pipeline/backcast_config.py) previously left
# `cc_duct_peaking` PJM-only and `cc_peaking_per_plant` unconditionally True
# for every ISO — deleting this dict without also fixing that default would
# have left ERCOT with NO per-plant peaking mechanism at all (silently
# regressing to the flat class-wide `pct_peaking`) unless a run happened to
# pass the existing `--cc-duct-peaking` CLI flag by hand, while simultaneously
# breaking every non-ERCOT ISO's default (`cc_peaking_per_plant` drives their
# real, already-keeper-validated CAMPD mechanism). Fixed: ERCOT's default is
# now `cc_duct_peaking=True` + `cc_peaking_per_plant=False`, matching every
# current ERCOT keeper exactly and generalizing the EIA-860 duct-burner
# mechanism to every ERCOT CC plant (not four named ones); CAISO/PJM/NYISO/
# NEISO/MISO defaults are restored to `cc_peaking_per_plant=True` unchanged.
# Extending `cc_duct_peaking` to those five ISOs by default is a distinct,
# real follow-up (EIA-860 would supersede their measured CAMPD mechanism for

# DOUBLE-COUNT SAFETY (FF-0D audit §1.6): because the near-era DEMAND_GROWTH_RATES

# that growth — it RELOCATES the block's energy out of the (peaky) grown demand
# and back as a flat block (energy invariant, 2030-continuity; CX-4 §3.5). So the
# block corrects DC's hourly SHAPE without double-counting its energy. At the MID
# path the DC block sits inside each ISO's total forecast (relocate regime); a
# high/full-queue path can exceed it and then adds as genuinely incremental load.
# FF-1C (2026-07, rule 23) refreshed the MISO block (was {}) and re-confirmed the

#
# RULE-14 BOUNDARY MISMATCH (audit C-17, B-NYI-1, open root-cause issue #1345):
# the published Zone-K requirement is now committed on disk
# (data/raw/capacity-deliverability/nyiso/nyiso.csv, intake PR #1261): LI LCR%
# (value_pu) 1.052 / 1.053 / 1.065 for 2023/24–2025/26 with a Bulk Power
# Transmission (import) limit of only 325 / 275 / 275 MW. That LCR is a
# PEAK-HOUR installed-capacity ratio (local ICAP >= ~105% of LI peak); THIS
# parameter is an ALL-HOURS energy self-supply fraction (frac x hourly demand).
# The two live on different boundaries: substituting the LCR% (~1.05) or the
# TSL-implied peak local fraction ((peak-import)/peak ~= 0.94) into an all-hours
# energy floor would force ~16 TWh/yr of LI generation vs the ~8.5 TWh that is
# physically real (LI imports off-peak, self-supplies near peak) — LESS
# reflective of reality, so a direct scalar re-ground is INADMISSIBLE (rule #14).
# The only scalar that reproduces the realized annual share would need a
# load-duration haircut tuned to the 2023 outcome — the very rule-12 pin C-17
# means to remove. The faithful fix is a MECHANISM change (a peak-capacity / TSL
# constraint from the committed LCR table), tracked in issue #1345. THAT
# MECHANISM NOW EXISTS: ScenarioConfig.nyiso_li_lcr_tsl (default off) caps the
# NYC->Long_Island link at the published locality import limit in the HB14-21
# window (transmission.apply_nyiso_li_tsl_import_cap) and EXCLUDES Long_Island
# from this floor (rule 19 — never stacked). Empirical reconciliation of the
# boundary (CEMS LI hourly gross gen + measured zonal load, 2023-25): measured
# implied LI inflow at the top-100 load hours is 1,493/1,440/1,598 MW vs the
# mechanism's in-window import capability (TSL + 1,200 MW external ties) of
# 1,525/1,475/1,475 MW — the published construction matches the measured
# peak-hour boundary within ~5%. When the flag is OFF this 0.45 value remains
# the legacy path (residual-identified, forecast-risk; DOF ledger S5). The 0.45
# magnitude still approximates the 2023 realized LI self-supply share (~0.48) —
# it is NOT a validated forward driver and MUST NOT be quoted as one.
#

#   - ComEd→AEP_Ohio      ← "50045005": REMOVED 2026-07-16 (pjm-cong-1).
#     Mis-attribution: the iso_configs "the 5004/5005 interface" naming of
#     the ComEd link was wrong (Manual 03 puts both circuits in
#     Pennsylvania); the real ComEd interface (CE-East) is not in the feed,
#     so the link rides its static — no measured series exists on that
#     boundary. Mapping 5004/5005 anywhere else would double-apply the
#     through-PA corridor the Eastern/Central/Western interfaces already
#     carry (rule 19); the series stays in the datatype unmapped.
#   - AEP_Ohio→Dominion   ← "AEP/DOM" (static 4069 = its 2024 mean).
#   - West_APS→SWMAAC     ← "AP-South" (static 4453 = its 2024 post mean).
#     MISALIGNMENT, documented: AP-South is the aggregate western→MAD 500 kV
#     flowgate, one of several parallel paths this 8-zone mesh splits across
#     West_APS→SWMAAC and West_APS→Dominion. It is applied ONLY to the
#     seeded link (West_APS→SWMAAC); West_APS→Dominion keeps its static
#     3,000 MW so the total west→MAD capability is the reconciled
#     measured-plus-static sum, never the single flowgate double-applied.
#   - West_APS→Central_PA ← "Bedington-BlackOak" (static 1947 = 2024 post
#     mean). Published post-contingency limits touch ≤ 0 in 2024-25 outage
#     windows; the consumer clamps the forward bound at 0 (no secure
#     transfer), never a negative bound (which would FORCE counterflow).
#   - AEP_Ohio→West_APS / ATSI→Central_PA / Central_PA→EMAAC ← the
#     "Average Western/Central/Eastern" regional envelopes that seeded their
#     statics (5029/3336/8168 = the 2024 means). MISALIGNMENT, documented:
#     an envelope is a regional mean across several member interfaces, not
#     one flowgate on the link's exact boundary (its measured ``transfers``
#     sign is unreliable for direction checks — Average Central runs
#     "negative" 80-97% of hours); the hourly envelope is still strictly
#     closer to the real capability than the constant it seeded.
# Cleveland is deliberately ABSENT (the N_TO_H pattern in
# ERCOT_GTC_LINK_MAP): it limits imports into the ATSI-Cleveland sub-pocket,
# a strict subset of the PJM_ATSI zone boundary, so applying it to
# AEP_Ohio→ATSI would cap the whole zone at one pocket's limit. SWMAAC→
# EMAAC, SWMAAC→Dominion, West_APS→Dominion and AEP_Ohio→ATSI have no
# published series on their boundary and keep their static estimates.
# Direction sanity (2023-25 measured ``transfers``): AP-South / Bedington-
# BlackOak / AEP-DOM flows are ≥ 98.5% one-directional west→east, matching
# the mapped links' forward orientation; binding (≥ 90% utilization) up to
# 6.5% of hours (BB post, 2025).
