# at the duct-burner peak multiplier) applied to exactly the four F-class(late)
# 2x1 CCs the model over-ran in the 80-90% CF range — not a published or
# physically-measured turbine limit, i.e. an answer-key scalar with no
# independent source. Confirmed dead at HEAD before deletion: the current
# ERCOT keeper (2026-07-06-ercot34-stage4-overlay-off) explicitly carries
# `cc_peaking_per_plant=False` (superseded by the measured EIA-860
# duct-burner mechanism, `cc_duct_peaking`/`fleet.cc_duct_peaking_pct`), and
# every non-ERCOT keeper's `cc_peaking_per_plant=True` drives only the
# CAMPD-measured `fleet.thermal_tranche_peaking` path — this dict's four
# ERCOT-specific plant codes never matched any other ISO's fleet. No keeper
# changes behavior from this deletion. Follow-up correction (same sweep): the
# ERCOT DEFAULT builder (pipeline/backcast_config.py) previously left
# `cc_duct_peaking` PJM-only and `cc_peaking_per_plant` unconditionally True
# for every ISO — deleting this dict without also fixing that default would
# have left ERCOT with NO per-plant peaking mechanism at all (silently
# regressing to the flat class-wide `pct_peaking`) unless a run happened to
# pass the existing `--cc-duct-peaking` CLI flag by hand, while simultaneously
# breaking every non-ERCOT ISO's default (`cc_peaking_per_plant` drives their
# real, already-keeper-validated CAMPD mechanism). Fixed: ERCOT's default is
# now `cc_duct_peaking=True` + `cc_peaking_per_plant=False`, matching every
# current ERCOT keeper exactly and generalizing the EIA-860 duct-burner
# mechanism to every ERCOT CC plant (not four named ones); CAISO/PJM/NYISO/
# NEISO/MISO defaults are restored to `cc_peaking_per_plant=True` unchanged.
# Extending `cc_duct_peaking` to those five ISOs by default is a distinct,
# real follow-up (EIA-860 would supersede their measured CAMPD mechanism for
# every EIA-860-covered plant) that needs its own per-ISO calibration probe +

# --- Regional Basis Differentials ($/MMBtu, relative to Henry Hub) ---
# Source: EIA Natural Gas Weekly Update, 2024-2025 average basis
# URL: https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/weekly/
# Waha (West Texas/ERCOT): historically trades at a discount to Henry Hub
#   due to Permian associated gas oversupply and pipeline constraints.
# SoCal Citygate (CAISO): historically trades at a premium to Henry Hub
#   due to pipeline constraints into California and limited local production.
#   Measured check (EIA-923 Schedule 5, quantity-weighted delivered gas to
#   CAISO plants minus Henry Hub annual average): +$7.06 in 2023 (the
#   Dec-22/Jan-23 western gas crisis — Jan-2023 delivered $38.7/MMBtu vs
#   HH $3.27), +$2.26 in 2024, +$1.12 in 2025. The +1.20 seed is only
#   right in a normal year; CAISO backcasts therefore default to
#   gas_monthly_actuals (measured ISO-month delivered gas), which makes
#   this scalar a forward-year/fallback value only.
# PJM: no single hub. PJM gas burn spans the Appalachian supply basin
#   (Dominion South / TETCO M2, a structural Marcellus *discount* to Henry
#   Hub from takeaway-constrained oversupply) and the Mid-Atlantic load
#   pocket (TETCO M3 and Transco Zone 6 non-NY, a modest annual *premium*
#   with large winter spikes). Rather than blend hub quotes by hand, the
#   +0.67 scalar is the empirical generation-weighted basis measured from
#   EIA-923 itself: the quantity-weighted delivered gas cost to PJM gas
#   plants (Schedule 5 fuel receipts) minus the Henry Hub annual average was
#   +$0.67/MMBtu in BOTH 2023 ($3.21 vs $2.54) and 2024 ($2.86 vs $2.19).
#   Source: scripts/derive_coal_supply.py-style EIA-923 receipt aggregation;
#   same EIA family as the ERCOT/CAISO figures. Caveat: Schedule-5 gas
#   reporting is sparse (~26 PJM plants), likely skewed toward the eastern
#   premium hubs, so this may run slightly high for the western price-taking
#   CCs — but it replaces the prior unvalidated +0.30 placeholder and lands
#   PJM CC dispatch on EIA-923 actuals without distorting the offer curve.
# NYISO: gas burn spans Transco Zone 6 NY / Iroquois (a steep winter premium
#   when downstate pipeline capacity is scarce) and the upstate path-priced
#   CCs. As with PJM, the +0.55 scalar is the generation-weighted basis
#   measured directly from EIA-923: the quantity-weighted delivered gas cost
#   to New York gas plants (Schedule 5 fuel receipts) minus the Henry Hub
#   annual average was +$0.53 (2023: 3.07 vs 2.54), +$0.44 (2024: 2.63 vs
#   2.19) and +$0.55 (2025: 4.08 vs 3.53) — a stable +0.54 quantity-weighted
#   over 2023-2025. Source: EIA-923 Schedule 5 receipt aggregation, same EIA
#   family as the ERCOT/CAISO/PJM figures. Caveat: a single annual scalar
#   flattens NY's pronounced winter blowout (the same Schedule-5 receipts show
#   monthly basis reaching +$3-7 in Jan/Dec) — enable
#   gas_plant_monthly_fuel_pricing for the monthly shape when winter price
#   fidelity matters.
# NEISO: New England gas burn prices off Algonquin Citygate (AGT), the
#   pipeline-constrained hub whose winter basis blows out to many multiples
#   of Henry Hub (doc-08 design decision 1). The +1.10 scalar is the
#   EIA-923 delivered-basis seed for *normal* (non-arctic-event) years:
#   quantity-weighted delivered gas cost to New England plants (Schedule 5
#   fuel receipts) minus the Henry Hub annual average was +$1.17 in 2024
#   (3.37 vs 2.19) and +$1.07 in Apr-Sep 2025 (4.60 vs 3.53); 2023 measured
#   +$3.17 (5.70 vs 2.54), inflated by the Jan/Feb-2023 arctic events
#   (Jan-23 delivered $15.17/MMBtu). Source: EIA-923 Schedule 5 receipt
#   aggregation, same EIA family as the other ISOs. STRONG caveat: only TWO
#   New England plants report Schedule-5 gas receipts (EIA plant codes 1660,
#   6081 — partly LNG-supplied), so the sample is far sparser than
#   PJM/NYISO. NEISO backcasts therefore default to gas_monthly_actuals +
#   the measured Algonquin hub-month basis overlay
#   (gas_hub_basis_overlay; data/raw/gas_basis_by_iso_month.csv),
#   which makes this scalar a forward-year/fallback value only — like the
#   CAISO +1.20 seed.
# MISO: a footprint-wide blend with no single hub. Northern MISO gas plants
#   (IL/WI/MI/MN) price off Chicago Citygate / MichCon (a modest premium driven
#   by interstate transport), while southern MISO (LA/MS/AR) prices essentially
#   at Henry Hub (near-zero basis). The public proxy is the EIA Illinois
#   natural-gas *citygate* series (n3050il3m): 2024 monthly avg = $3.495/Mcf
#   = $3.37/MMBtu (1 Mcf ~ 1.037 MMBtu) vs Henry Hub $2.22/MMBtu -> a raw
#   +$1.15/MMBtu. BUT that EIA "citygate" is the LDC-delivered price (it bakes
#   in full distribution transport), an UPPER BOUND that overstates power-plant
#   burn cost: the Chicago Citygate *trading hub* spot traded ~Henry Hub parity
#   in 2024 (Midwest hubs were weak vs HH), and most MISO gas plants buy nearer
#   the trading hub plus a small transport adder, not the LDC citygate. To keep
#   MISO on the same plant-delivered footing as the PJM/NYISO EIA-923 basis
#   (and not overstate the large southern-MISO Henry-Hub-priced fleet), we
#   reconcile the LDC-citygate proxy down to a footprint blend of +0.30/MMBtu
#   (≈ trading-hub parity + modest northern transport, net of ~$0 southern
#   basis). Refine with EIA-923 MISO Schedule-5 plant receipts in M8.

# Baseline logistic slope (per $/MMBtu) for a coal supply group whose plants
# all draw one producing region, so the annual region f.o.b. resolves no
# cross-plant crossover dispersion (e.g. MISO's all-PRB group). The physical
# crossover-sharpness prior at the mechanism's established scale; a multi-region
# group (e.g. MISO bituminous spanning IL/IN/KY/ENC) instead derives its slope
# from the real across-region delivered-cost dispersion. Clipped to
# [SLOPE_MIN, SLOPE_MAX]. PPI intra-year variability adds a (small, ~2% CV)
# fuzzing term to the dispersion.

# Delivered oil fuel price ($/MMBtu) for oil-fired peakers and steam units.
# Distillate (No. 2) fuel oil dominates the NYISO/ISO-NE oil peaker fleet;
# residual (No. 6) is the legacy oil-steam fuel. The blended delivered cost
# sits far above gas, so oil clears only in scarcity (peaker behaviour) —
# critical to Northeast winter price formation. Held flat (no commodity
# trajectory) since oil rarely runs and is not a price-setting baseload fuel.
# Source: EIA distillate (~$20/MMBtu) and residual (~$14/MMBtu) fuel oil
# delivered to the electric power sector, 2023-2024 average.
# Also the dual-fuel switching parity fallback: in backcast years the measured
# EIA-923 Schedule 5 monthly Petroleum receipt series
# (market_sim.data.fuel.iso_monthly_oil_prices; PJM ~$17-23/MMBtu, 2023-2025)
# takes precedence, and this flat value fills unreported months and any
# forecast year outside OIL_PRICE_TRAJECTORIES' range.

# AEO2025 Table 12 ("Petroleum and Other Liquids Prices"), electric-power
# distillate + residual fuel oil, averaged (same blend construction as
# OIL_PRICE_PER_MMBTU above) — data/raw/eia-aeo/
# eia_aeo2025_fuel_prices.part*.csv, derived via
# scripts/derive_fuel_trajectories.py::derive_oil_trajectory (P-1D, CLAUDE.md
# rule 23). AEO prices this series at $/gal; converted to $/MMBtu via EIA fuel
# heat contents (0.1385 MMBtu/gal distillate, 0.1497 MMBtu/gal residual).

# months keep the measured EIA-923 receipt series; OIL_PRICE_PER_MMBTU stays
# the fallback for unreported backcast months and any year outside this
