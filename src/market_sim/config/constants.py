# DELETED 2026-07 (rule 26, G-26/C-12/issue #1335-adjacent audit sweep): a

# at the duct-burner peak multiplier) applied to exactly the four F-class(late)
# 2x1 CCs the model over-ran in the 80-90% CF range — not a published or
# physically-measured turbine limit, i.e. an answer-key scalar with no
# independent source. Confirmed dead at HEAD before deletion: the current
# ERCOT keeper (2026-07-06-ercot34-stage4-overlay-off) explicitly carries
# `cc_peaking_per_plant=False` (superseded by the measured EIA-860
# duct-burner mechanism, `cc_duct_peaking`/`fleet.cc_duct_peaking_pct`), and
# every non-ERCOT keeper's `cc_peaking_per_plant=True` drives only the
# CAMPD-measured `fleet.thermal_tranche_peaking` path — this dict's four
# ERCOT-specific plant codes never matched any other ISO's fleet. No keeper
# changes behavior from this deletion. Follow-up correction (same sweep): the
# ERCOT DEFAULT builder (pipeline/backcast_config.py) previously left
# `cc_duct_peaking` PJM-only and `cc_peaking_per_plant` unconditionally True
# for every ISO — deleting this dict without also fixing that default would
# have left ERCOT with NO per-plant peaking mechanism at all (silently
# regressing to the flat class-wide `pct_peaking`) unless a run happened to
# pass the existing `--cc-duct-peaking` CLI flag by hand, while simultaneously
# breaking every non-ERCOT ISO's default (`cc_peaking_per_plant` drives their
# real, already-keeper-validated CAMPD mechanism). Fixed: ERCOT's default is
# now `cc_duct_peaking=True` + `cc_peaking_per_plant=False`, matching every
# current ERCOT keeper exactly and generalizing the EIA-860 duct-burner
# mechanism to every ERCOT CC plant (not four named ones); CAISO/PJM/NYISO/
# NEISO/MISO defaults are restored to `cc_peaking_per_plant=True` unchanged.
# Extending `cc_duct_peaking` to those five ISOs by default is a distinct,
# real follow-up (EIA-860 would supersede their measured CAMPD mechanism for
# every EIA-860-covered plant) that needs its own per-ISO calibration probe +
