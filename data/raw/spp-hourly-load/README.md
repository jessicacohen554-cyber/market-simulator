# `spp-hourly-load` — SPP hourly load by area

Opened **2026-09-06** by lane **SPP-12** (`docs/multi-iso/spp-addition-plan-2026-09.md`
§5 row SPP-12) as part of the SPP addition program. Source of record:
`SOURCES.md` beside this file.

## What this is

This is the **zonal load** input for an SPP backcast (manifest row 6,
`docs/multi-iso/spp-addition-plan-2026-09.md` §6). It is the ISO-published
counterpart to the EIA-930 sub-BA demand that lane SPP-11 fetches: where the
sub-BA product gives ~17 EIA-defined sub-balancing areas, this product gives
SPP's own Balancing Area / legacy Control Area rollup, which is the boundary
SPP's own market reports use. Whichever of the two is used, the other is the
cross-check — and per rule 14 `[R-ACCURATE]` a disagreement between them is a
finding to root-cause, never a reason to pick the one that fits better.

## SPP product(s)

| `fsName` | SPP page title | SPP's own description |
|---|---|---|
| `hourly-load` | Hourly Load | Historical load data rolled up at an hourly level and grouped by Balancing Area Name and Control Area (legacy BA). |

The descriptions are quoted from SPP's page metadata
(`GET https://portal.spp.org/api/pageConfig/by-slug/<slug>`, read 2026-09-06) —
they are SPP's words, not this repo's summary of the product.

## Expected schema and span

Expected shape (from SPP's product description above — **not** yet verified
against a delivered file): one row per hour per area, columns for the interval
stamp, Balancing Area Name, Control Area, and MW. Span on the portal is a rolling
window with archived years as `/<year>/<year>.zip`; the backcast needs
**2023-2025**, and 2019-2022 only as a rule-22 intake batch after a `complete`
marker.

## Timezone

SPP operates on **Central Prevailing Time** (`America/Chicago`) — the model's
dispatch clock for this ISO, and the same convention
`scripts/data/fetch_eia930_hourly.py` and `convert_eia930.py` already use for the
`SWPP` BA. SPP's monthly hourly rollups are published hour-ending `HE01..HE24` on
the local clock with the DST 23/25-hour days pre-folded into 24 columns; the
5-minute interval products are stamped in local time. Confirm against the first
delivered file rather than assuming.

## STATUS AT OPENING — EMPTY, PORTAL BLOCKED (2026-09-06)

**This directory carries no data files yet.** SPP's public file-browser stopped
serving data to anonymous callers; lane SPP-12 re-discovered the API from the
portal's own JS bundle and confirmed the request grammar is correct and the
product is still flagged public, but the response carries nothing.

Measured 2026-09-06 (details, and the full reachable/blocked table:
`docs/handoffs/FINDING-spp-12-2026-09-06.md`):

| Call | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET /file-browser-api/?fsName={fs}&path=&type=folder` | HTTP **200** with a literal `[]`, at every `path`/`type` form tried |
| `GET /file-browser-api/download/{fs}?path=...` | HTTP **404**, zero bytes |
| `GET /api/pageConfig/by-slug/{slug}` | HTTP 200, `isPublic: true` — the product is still declared public |
| `GET /api/principal` | `unauthenticatedUser: true`, `uiTokenPresent: false` |

The responses are SPP's own Tomcat (`JSESSIONID` + Spring-Security headers), not
an intermediary, and an invented `fsName` **404s** where a real one **200s** — so
the `200`-with-`[]` is an authorization outcome, not a wrong key. Both calls now
carry an `X-SPP-UI-Token` header in the SPA; this repo has no Marketplace
credential to populate it.

**How to fill this directory when a credential exists.** Re-read the current
endpoint form from the portal bundle first (`https://portal.spp.org/static/js/main.<hash>.js`
— the hash changes; `e2bac944` on 2026-09-06) rather than trusting this file, then
list and download per `SOURCES.md`. SPP's own **"SPP Public Data Access"** guide
(Stakeholder Center > User Guides, APIs & Integrations > Technical Reference
Documents > Public Data) documents both the Portal and an **FTP** route to these
same products; the FTP route has not been tried and may not need the UI token.

**Raw files land here untouched** — exactly as downloaded, never edited in place
(the `data/raw/` contract). Record the observed schema, span and timezone in the
table above this line when the first files land.
