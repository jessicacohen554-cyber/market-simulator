# `spp-genmix` — SPP historical generation mix

Opened **2026-09-06** by lane **SPP-12** (`docs/multi-iso/spp-addition-plan-2026-09.md`
§5 row SPP-12) as part of the SPP addition program. Source of record:
`SOURCES.md` beside this file.

## What this is

Manifest row 7. Two uses: (a) a fuel-mix sanity check on the first SPP solve —
card **P7** names "fuel-mix within order of magnitude of EIA-923" as part of the
first-solve structural STOP gate; (b) **delivered wind is the HSL denominator**.
The curtailment rate this program needs is
`curtailed / (delivered + curtailed)`, and this product supplies the `delivered`
leg while `spp-hsl/` supplies the curtailed leg. Without it the curtailment
figures in `spp-hsl/` stay as SPP publishes them (average hourly MW) and any
percentage is a derivation carrying its own arithmetic, not a published rate.

## SPP product(s)

| `fsName` | SPP page title | SPP's own description |
|---|---|---|
| `generation-mix-historical` | Generation Mix Historical | Historical generation mix files showing percentage generation by fuel type. |

The descriptions are quoted from SPP's page metadata
(`GET https://portal.spp.org/api/pageConfig/by-slug/<slug>`, read 2026-09-06) —
they are SPP's words, not this repo's summary of the product.

## Expected schema and span

Expected shape: per-interval or per-hour generation by fuel type, published as
percentages (SPP's description says "percentage generation by fuel type"), so a
MW/MWh denominator may need the load product alongside it. Verify before use —
a percentage series cannot serve as an energy denominator on its own.

## Timezone

SPP operates on **Central Prevailing Time** (`America/Chicago`) — the model's
dispatch clock for this ISO, and the same convention
`scripts/data/fetch_eia930_hourly.py` and `convert_eia930.py` already use for the
`SWPP` BA. SPP's monthly hourly rollups are published hour-ending `HE01..HE24` on
the local clock with the DST 23/25-hour days pre-folded into 24 columns; the
5-minute interval products are stamped in local time. Confirm against the first
delivered file rather than assuming.

## STATUS AT OPENING — EMPTY, PORTAL BLOCKED (2026-09-06)

**This directory carries no data files yet.** SPP's public file-browser stopped
serving data to anonymous callers; lane SPP-12 re-discovered the API from the
portal's own JS bundle and confirmed the request grammar is correct and the
product is still flagged public, but the response carries nothing.

Measured 2026-09-06 (details, and the full reachable/blocked table:
`docs/handoffs/FINDING-spp-12-2026-09-06.md`):

| Call | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET /file-browser-api/?fsName={fs}&path=&type=folder` | HTTP **200** with a literal `[]`, at every `path`/`type` form tried |
| `GET /file-browser-api/download/{fs}?path=...` | HTTP **404**, zero bytes |
| `GET /api/pageConfig/by-slug/{slug}` | HTTP 200, `isPublic: true` — the product is still declared public |
| `GET /api/principal` | `unauthenticatedUser: true`, `uiTokenPresent: false` |

The responses are SPP's own Tomcat (`JSESSIONID` + Spring-Security headers), not
an intermediary, and an invented `fsName` **404s** where a real one **200s** — so
the `200`-with-`[]` is an authorization outcome, not a wrong key. Both calls now
carry an `X-SPP-UI-Token` header in the SPA; this repo has no Marketplace
credential to populate it.

**How to fill this directory when a credential exists.** Re-read the current
endpoint form from the portal bundle first (`https://portal.spp.org/static/js/main.<hash>.js`
— the hash changes; `e2bac944` on 2026-09-06) rather than trusting this file, then
list and download per `SOURCES.md`. SPP's own **"SPP Public Data Access"** guide
(Stakeholder Center > User Guides, APIs & Integrations > Technical Reference
Documents > Public Data) documents both the Portal and an **FTP** route to these
same products; the FTP route has not been tried and may not need the UI token.

**Raw files land here untouched** — exactly as downloaded, never edited in place
(the `data/raw/` contract). Record the observed schema, span and timezone in the
table above this line when the first files land.
